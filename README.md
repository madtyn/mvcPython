# mvcPython

This is a little skeleton for a MVC python application with tkinter 
intended as a reference for future projects.

1) Be sure to have tkinter installed within your python installation
2) Install from the requirements.txt all required packages in your python env
3) Run the main.py python file


ALTERNATIVE EXECUTION: For only testing the view without the model or controller, 
you can just:

    python -m view.view

from the project's directory. In this way you can check, test and develope the 
View without caring about the Model or Controller. They could be incomplete or 
yet to be done.

You can read the source code and mess with it for understanding it. 
The GUI has inputs, buttons, lists, calendars, comboboxes, textareas... 
It only lacks a menubar.

I hope it suits you. Be my guest.
